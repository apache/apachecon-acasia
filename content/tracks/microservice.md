Microservices architecture remains the foundational framework for building the vast majority of applications today, not to mention the substantial existing ecosystem of microservice-based applications. Therefore, exploring how to construct efficient and stable microservices architectures should always be a primary focus.

We have also observed the rapid advancement of AI agent technologies. Microservices need to consider integration with AI agent technologiesâ€”such as enhancing the efficiency and stability of agent development, and enabling rapid adoption of intelligent capabilities for existing microservices applications.
