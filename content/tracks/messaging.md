With the large-scale landing of serverless, IoT and real-time data technology, event-driven architecture and event streaming technology have been more widely applied, making message queue become more and more important infrastructure. Today, a number of excellent  messaging projects have emerged in the Apache ecosystem, including
[Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/), [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), [Apache RocketMQ](https://rocketmq.apache.org/), [Apache ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/), [Apache Inlong](https://inlong.apache.org/), etc, facing new technological trends, each messaging project is also continuing to evolve. 

In this topic, you will learn how different messaging systems make the best technical evolution direction based on their own architectural characteristics, including storage and computing separation,  serverless, messaging-streaming integration,and so on.  You can also learn how major manufacturers choose the right messaging technology based on their own industry characteristics and business scenarios, and obtain the best practices of messaging technology.
