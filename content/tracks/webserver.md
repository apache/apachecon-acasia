With the growing demands of modern web applications, building efficient, scalable, and secure web systems has become a core objective of technological development.  

Within the Apache ecosystem, numerous outstanding projects have emerged, ranging from classic web servers (such as Tomcat, HTTP Server) to essential development tools (like Apache Commons, FreeMarker, Echarts), as well as frameworks specializing in enterprise-level integration and security (e.g., Camel, Shiro). These projects play critical roles in modern web architectures.  

Here, you will gain in-depth insights into the latest developments of these projects, learn best practices for production environments, and explore their future directions.
