The AI Sub-forum is a professional exchange platform focusing on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and Apache open-source projects. This sub-forum aims to bring together developers, researchers, and industry users from around the world to explore the application and development of AI technology in the open-source ecosystem, showcase cutting-edge technologies, share practical experience, and promote the implementation of open-source AI solutions across various industries. Topics suitable for this sub-forum include:

* AI-related projects under the Apache Foundation (e.g., focusing on open-source AI frameworks and foundational libraries such as Apache TVM, Mahout, Singa, SystemML, etc.).
* Optimization of individual Apache projects in AI scenarios (e.g., projects like Spark MLlib, Flink ML).

* AI solutions in industrial scenarios based on combinations of multiple Apache projects (e.g., methods for building AI businesses by certain enterprises using a combination of Apache projects).
