Whether in the era of Cloud Native or AI-led transformation today, microservices remain the cornerstone of underlying systems, helping us build resilient and scalable distributed systems. Join us as we uncover:

* High-Performance RPC Frameworks – Learn how projects like Apache Dubbo, Apache Thrift, and Apache bRPC are redefining service-to-service communication with speed, efficiency, and interoperability.

* AI-Driven Microservices – Discover how AI and ML are revolutionizing service orchestration, anomaly detection, and autonomous scaling in microservice ecosystems.

* The Next-Gen Service Mesh – Beyond traditional sidecars, we explore the rise of Proxyless Service Mesh and how it transforms observability, security, and traffic management in cloud-native environments.

* Cloud-Native Microservices – From Kubernetes to serverless, we discuss how cloud-native principles optimize microservice architectures for scalability, resilience, and automation.
