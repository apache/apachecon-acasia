I will start by explaining a little bit about the project, itâ€™s differentials and how the CI/CD process helped it to succeed.

The second part will explain the process and the most important decisions and suggestions that I got from friends and co-workers (highlighting the importance of sharing your personal projects with people you thrust).

Third part will speak about how to get financial support for a free and Open Source project. Here I will also reveal what I would do differently if I could go back in time.

Last part will provide valorous advices for who is starting or looking for a project to start. I will also try to finish the presentation by inspiring people to do the same I did (or even better).

As a passionate full-stack web developer with a deep enthusiasm for technology, I have cultivated a diverse and extensive skill set in software development, contributing to a variety of projects across different industries. My technical expertise encompasses a wide spectrum of programming languages and solution platforms, making me adept at navigating complex technological landscapes.

Since embarking on my programming career in 2011, I have developed proficiency in an array of programming languages and frameworks. My repertoire includes JavaScript with its various frameworks and libraries (Express, NestJS, loopback.io, React, Angular), C# with .NET Core, PHP with popular frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, Yii), Python using Flask, and Java with Spring. This broad skill set enables me to effectively tackle unique project requirements, ensuring that each solution I deliver is not only tailored to specific needs but also upholds the highest standards of quality and innovation. My commitment to each project goes beyond just meeting specifications; it's about creating solutions that drive progress and make a meaningful impact.
