As the demand for analyzing and computing complex relational graph data in the big data domain continues to grow, the need for real-time graph computing capabilities in scenarios such as financial risk control and group detection is also on the rise. This requires large-scale graph computation engines to simultaneously provide low latency and high throughput. Currently, stream-batch integrated computing engines are the future direction, but the iterative nature of graph computation differs fundamentally from traditional stream and batch processing. Building a stream-batch-graph integrated computing engine around graph iteration poses a significant challenge. GeaFlow, independently developed by the Ant Group's graph computing team, is the industry's first large-scale distributed streaming graph computing engine, supporting real-time graph computing, offline graph computing, and online exploratory analysis on large-scale graphs. In this presentation, we will introduce how GeaFlow splits execution jobs into stream, batch, and graph tasks, orchestrates them in a unified manner, and constructs an efficient stream-batch-graph integrated scheduling and execution framework.
