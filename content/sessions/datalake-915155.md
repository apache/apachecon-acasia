Apache Cloudberry is an advanced and mature open-source MPP database, derived from the open-source version of the Pivotal Greenplum Database® but built on a more modern PostgreSQL kernel and with more advanced enterprise capabilities. Cloudberry can serve as a data warehouse and can also be used for large-scale analytics and AI/ML workloads.
In this session, we’ll explore the origin of the project, its journey into the Apache Incubator, and how it differentiates itself from other analytical databases. We will introduce Cloudberry’s core features, architectural highlights, and share its future roadmap. This session will also provide a brief comparison with other data warehouse systems, helping the audience understand where Apache Cloudberry stands in the ecosystem and what’s coming next.
