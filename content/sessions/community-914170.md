The open-source world is an ecosystem in which projects and communities are interconnected. Understanding a project's health through measurements and seeking suitable means to achieve a prosperous and sustainable open-source software community is a topic of great concern for both maintainers and community developers. The health of an open-source project is not limited to traditional metrics of software engineering quality and iteration management; it also encompasses factors such as community status and values within open collaboration.

The developer ecosystem and community atmosphere play a significant role in these evaluations, which presents substantial challenges in effectively measuring community healthâ€”whether it be through data collection, identity authentication, or the construction of evaluation metrics.

In this talk, two members of the CHAOSS community will discuss the challenges of measuring open-source community health based on CHAOSS metrics, as well as a series of practical implementations in enterprises, including:
 1.Macro observability of overall ecological trends;
 2. Meso-level insights into the observability of open-source community ecosystems;
 3. Micro-level evaluations and incentives for developer contributions.

Additionally, this session will feature a Birds of a Feather (BoF) segment, inviting project owners (practitioners) and researchers in attendance to discuss the challenges faced during project maintenance and how measurements and operations can help communities grow better.
