OceanBase Database is a distributed relational database developed by Ant Group. It has been supporting the Double 11 Shopping Festival for 11 years. It started as an e-commerce database used by Taobao Favorites and gradually became the database of all core systems of Ant Group. It then grew into the database of core systems of many enterprises, especially the financial industry. 

The database is responsible for data storage and management. It is the core guarantee of the application system. Every year, Alibaba and Ant Group will bring a huge amount of traffic during Double 11. This traffic makes all systems complicated. The database also bears the requirements of stability and data accuracy, making the stability and data accuracy of a distributed database a world-class problem. 

Faced with such a world-class problem, OceanBase was officially open sourced in June 2021. This sharing will take the practice of the open source OceanBase as an example to share how to build a healthy and vibrant open source community from 0 to 1, including the decision-making thinking of enterprise-level open source projects from commercialization to open source, the ecological exploration of open source projects from inside to outside, and the construction of a healthy and active open source community.

For more detailed information about our community, there are developer events, technical blogs, online training classes and forum: https://open.oceanbase.com/
