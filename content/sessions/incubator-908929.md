A successful release in an Apache project is never a one-person show. In this talk, I’ll share how the Apache OzHera (Incubating) community worked together to deliver its first release—not just as a task for the release manager, but as a shared responsibility across the entire community. From writing release notes and reviewing code to testing artifacts and voting on the mailing list, every step required collective effort and collaboration. I’ll reflect on how we moved from a “solo contributor” mindset to a culture of shared ownership, and offer insights into how other communities—especially those in the Incubator—can encourage broader participation in their release processes. If you’ve ever felt like the release process rests on your shoulders alone, maybe this session will show you how to turn that burden into a team victory.
