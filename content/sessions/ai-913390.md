With AI's growing popularity, Kubernetes has become the de facto AI infrastructure. However, the increasing number of clusters with diverse AI devices (e.g., NVIDIA, Intel, Huawei Ascend,Hygon,Metax,Cambrian,Mthreads,iluvatar) presents a major challenge.
AI devices are expensive, how to better improve resource utilization? How to better integrate with K8s clusters? How to manage heterogeneous AI devices consistently, support flexible scheduling policies, and observability all bring many challenges
The HAMi project was born for this purpose. This session including:

* How K8s manages heterogeneous AI devices (unified scheduling, observability)
* How to improve device usage by GPU share
* how to ensure the QOS of high-priority tasks in GPU share stories
* Support flexible scheduling strategies for GPU (NUMA affinity/anti-affinity, binpack/spread etc)
* Integration with other projects (such as volcano, scheduler-plugin, etc.)
* Real-world case studies from production-level users.
* Some other challenges still faced and roadmap
