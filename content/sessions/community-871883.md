Getting started with open source can be daunting, but every experienced contributor was once a beginner. In this talk, I will share my personal journeyâ€”from my first pull request to becoming an Apache Committer and the maintainer of multiple open-source projects. Drawing from my experience open-source initiatives, I will discuss how newcomers can effectively contribute to projects, build their reputation, and expand their influence within the community. Additionally, I will explore strategies for fostering community engagement, making meaningful contributions beyond code. Whether you're new to open source or looking to deepen your involvement, this session will provide practical insights and guidance on growing within an open-source ecosystem.
