This session will delve into Yili Group's implementation journey with Apache DolphinScheduler, a powerful open-source workflow orchestration tool. We will share practical insights into how we tailored DolphinScheduler to meet the specific needs of large-scale dairy production and supply chain management, including:  
1. **Custom Development**:  
   - Extended functionalities for complex ETL workflows, resource quota management, and integration with internal systems (e.g., ERP, IoT platforms).  
   - Optimization strategies for high-concurrency task scheduling in hybrid cloud environments.  
2. **Monitoring & Alerting**:  
   - Enhanced monitoring dashboards for real-time tracking of workflow health, task latency, and resource utilization.  
   - Custom alerting mechanisms integrated with enterprise communication tools (e.g., DingTalk, WeCom).  
3. **Operational Best Practices**:  
   - Lessons learned in cluster performance tuning, disaster recovery, and version upgrade strategies.  
   - Metrics-driven approaches to improve system stability and reduce O&M costs.  
4. **Community Collaboration**:  
   - Contributions back to the Apache DolphinScheduler community, including feature enhancements and bug fixes.
