This submission explores the practical application of Dubbo-go, the Go implementation of Apache Dubbo, within a modern microservice architecture. It highlights how Dubbo-go enables high-performance RPC communication, service discovery, and seamless integration with cloud-native infrastructure. The talk will cover real-world usage scenarios, including service governance, interface definition, and inter-language communication with Java-based Dubbo services. By sharing hands-on experience and best practices, the session aims to demonstrate how Dubbo-go can serve as a robust and scalable solution for building production-ready microservices in Go.
