As open source becomes vital for global innovation, the impact of policymaking on its growth is crucial. This keynote explores the unique challenges and opportunities for Asia's open source ecosystem, contrasting it with Western legislative frameworks like the U.S. CHIPS Act and Europe’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). While these policies aim to enhance technological leadership, Asia’s approach—shaped by its cultural and geopolitical context—presents a distinct narrative.

With initiatives like China’s 14th Five-Year Plan promoting indigenous technologies, Taiwan’s g0v community driving civic tech innovation, and India's policy on adoption of OSS in e-Governance, Asia is forging its path. However, challenges such as fragmented ecosystems and cultural hesitations remain. This keynote aims to encourage stakeholders to rethink strategies for open source by not only bridging policy gaps but also fostering collaboration between regional open source communities and the wider ecosystem.
