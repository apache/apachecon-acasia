This session challenges the norm by presenting a new way of thinking about consensus as a scalability solution. In this session, we first analyze the mismatch between conventional consensus designs like Raft or Paxos and the unique semantics of LSM-based OLAP systems. Then we introduce a state replication framework tailored to LSM's hierarchical storage structure to address this gap. By leveraging the high compression ratio of LSM's sorted string tables (SSTables), this approach enables parallel state propagation across replicas, reducing consensus overhead and allowing performance to scale with the number of replicas rather than decline. 
We've implemented this innovative consensus approach within Apache IoTDB. Testing has shown remarkable results. Our consensus engine scales linearly with replica count, turning what was once a performance burden into a throughput booster and enhancing both system durability and throughput without sacrificing performance.
