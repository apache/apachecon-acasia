As microservice architectures continue to evolve, there is an increasing demand for communication frameworks with enhanced flexibility, universality, and performance. A notable industry example is the newly introduced Triple X protocol by Apache Dubbo, which breaks the boundaries of traditional RPC communication methods. It achieves unified access, protocol-agnostic operation, and enhanced semantic communication capabilities, while fully supporting mainstream protocols such as HTTP/2, gRPC, and Protobuf, greatly improving the compatibility and development efficiency of heterogeneous systems. This presentation will explore the design philosophy and key features of Triple X, demonstrating how it revolutionizes service governance, observability, and multi-language ecosystems. We will also share practical experiences from real business implementations, helping developers quickly embrace this new generation of communication paradigms and accelerate the intelligent evolution of microservice systems.
