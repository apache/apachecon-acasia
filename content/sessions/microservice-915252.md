As the microservice architecture continues to evolve, the flexibility, versatility and performance of communication frameworks have put forward higher requirements. A typical representative in the industry is the Triple X protocol introduced by Apache Dubbo, which breaks through the boundaries of traditional RPC communication, realizes unified access, protocol-independent, semantically enhanced communication capabilities, and comprehensively supports mainstream protocols such as HTTP/2, gRPC, Protobuf, etc., which greatly improves the compatibility and development efficiency of heterogeneous systems. Based on the design concept and key features of Triple X, this presentation will show how it brings changes to service governance, observability and multilingual ecosystem, and at the same time share practical experience in real business to help developers quickly embrace the new generation of communication paradigm and accelerate the intelligent evolution of microservice system.
