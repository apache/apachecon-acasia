This session explores the transformative potential of integrating Generative AI (GenAI) into Apache OpenMeetings, an open-source web conferencing tool. We’ll demonstrate how GenAI can elevate virtual collaboration through features like real-time multilingual transcription, AI-generated meeting summaries, and intelligent meeting assistants that automate action items. Attendees will learn how to extend OpenMeetings using LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) and open-source frameworks to create dynamic virtual avatars, context-aware chatbots, and personalized content recommendations. We’ll showcase use cases such as AI-driven customer support portals, interactive training sessions, and automated post-meeting workflows. Technical integration strategies, including API design and ethical considerations (data privacy, bias mitigation), will be discussed. We’ll highlight existing community plugins and pathways for contributors to engage. Whether you’re a developer, product owner, or AI enthusiast, this session will equip you with actionable insights to reimagine virtual collaboration in education, enterprise, and beyond. Join us to shape the future of open-source communication tools!

Wentao Liu: Business Development Manager at ictrek.com 

Wentao has more than 20 years of experience in the Linux community. In his earlier Linux activities, he applied LVS technology in producing Layer 4 switches. Now, as an advocate of LLMs and cloud-native, he is focusing on the area of AI agents, LLMs and RAG, AI/ML integration with Kubernetes, especially on MLOps and Speech-to-text application integration. He spoke at several open source conferences, such as FOSSASIA, ApacheCon, and FOSDEM to share his learning experience of open source technologies. 

在 Linux 社区拥有超过20年的丰富经验。在早期的 Linux 技术实践中，他曾将 LVS 技术成功应用于第四层交换机的研发生产。如今，作为大语言模型（LLMs）和云原生技术的倡导者，他正专注于AI智能体、大语言模型与检索增强生成（RAG）、AI/ML 与 Kubernetes 的集成等前沿领域，特别是在MLOps和语音转文字（Speech-to-text）应用集成方面进行深入研究。他曾在 FOSSASIA、ApacheCon、FOSDEM 等多个开源技术大会上发表演讲，分享其在开源技术领域的学习与实践经验。
