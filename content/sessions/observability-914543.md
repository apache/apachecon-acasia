In today's dynamic cloud ecosystems, many enterprises find themselves navigating the complexities of using multiple observability stacks due to architectural migrations, team preferences, or language support limitations. Specifically, Apache SkyWalking and OpenTelemetry, both powerful in their own right, often coexist within the same production environment. However, this coexistence frequently leads to compatibility challenges that can manifest as broken traces, failed plugin enhancements, and, in severe cases, business call errors and application startup failures.
In this session at CommunityOverCode Asia 2025, I will share our journey and methodologies that enabled seamless integration of Apache SkyWalking and OpenTelemetry. Key discussion points will include:
● Multi-JavaAgent Compatibility: Explore strategies to resolve class enhancement conflicts and application startup failures in Java applications utilizing multiple Java Agent.
● Multi-Protocol Compatibility: Address the issue of broken traces resulting from simultaneous use of sw8 and W3C trace context protocols within the same call chain.
● Best Practices for Observability Stack Migration: Provide insights and recommendations for effectively migrating between Apache SkyWalking and OpenTelemetry stacks, including key considerations and best practices.
The goal of this presentation is to equip enterprises using both Apache SkyWalking and OpenTelemetry with practical guidance to manage compatibility challenges, enhancing system stability and performance. Join us to explore these solutions and engage with the community for innovative discussions.
