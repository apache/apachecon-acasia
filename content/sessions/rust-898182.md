RobustMQ is an open source project in the field of message queuing, built on top of Apache OpenDAL and written 100% in Rust. Its goal is to build a next-generation converged message queue with high performance, high availability, compatibility with a variety of mainstream message queue protocols, and complete Serverless capabilities on the architecture.

It is based on Apache OpenDAL connecting object Storage (S3), HDFS, File, MySQL, Redis and many other different storage engines. It shields the differences of underlying storage engines to create a pluggable, Serverless storage layer architecture.

The design and development of the overall distributed layered architecture has been completed. Full support for all features of the MQTT3/4/5 protocol is available, and the first RobustMQ MQTT Release is available. The Kafka protocol will be supported next.

It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and its vision is to create a competitive message queuing product for the age of AI. And became a top-level project of the Apache Foundation.

 Its features are as follows:
- 100% Rust: A message queuing kernel implemented entirely in Rust. 
- Multi-protocol: Support MQTT 3.1/3.1.1/5.0, AMQP, RocketMQ Remoting/GRPC, Kafka Protocol, OpenMessing, JNS, SQS and other mainstream message protocols.
- Layered architecture: computing, storage, scheduling independent three-tier architecture, each layer has the ability of cluster deployment, rapid horizontal scaling capacity.
 - Plug-in storage: Standalone plug-in storage layer implementation, you can choose the appropriate storage layer according to your needs. It is compatible with traditional and cloud-native architectures, and supports cloud and IDC deployment patterns. 
- High cohesion architecture: It provides built-in metadata storage components, distributed Journal storage services, and has the ability to deploy quickly, easily and cohesively. 
- Rich functions: support sequential messages, dead message messages, transaction messages, idempotent messages, delay messages and other rich message queue functions.
