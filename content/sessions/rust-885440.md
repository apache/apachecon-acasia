Rust is rapidly becoming a key player in data infrastructure, with many new big data systems being developed in Rust. This trend, known as "Rewrite Bigdata in Rust" (RBIR), aims to build a modern big data ecosystem using Rust. RBIR consists of three approaches: creating new Rust-based projects, re-implementing existing systems in Rust, and integrating Rust-powered components into other languages. The movement is driven by Rust's thriving community, excellent tooling, and strong return on investment. This talk will explore the motivations behind RBIR, highlight successful projects, and discuss how developers can contribute to this growing ecosystem.
