Fineract showcases how open-source collaboration between for-profit and non-profit organizations can transform Asia’s fintech landscape, offering a scalable, inclusive alternative to costly core banking solutions.

The Apache Fineract ecosystem, born from Mifos X’s backend, powers financial inclusion for over 6 million clients across 36 countries. This lightning talk showcases how a global community of for-profit and non-profit organizations collaborates on Fineract, an open-source banking platform rivaling Temenos and Oracle Flexcube. With over 59 partners across 17 regions—spanning Africa, Asia, the Americas, and beyond—the ecosystem blends commercial scalability with social impact. For-profits like BaaSFlow deliver cloud-hosted solutions for neobanks, while non-profits like the Mifos Initiative drive open-source contributions via volunteers and Google Summer of Code. Learn how Fineract’s API-driven architecture and modular design enable rapid innovation, serving 2 billion unbanked with cost-effective, extensible financial services.

Asian Leadership: 38 partners, including Conflux Technologies (India), Habile Technologies (India), and Southeast Asian innovators, serve microfinance, SACCOs, and neobanks across India, China, the Philippines, and beyond.

For-Profit Innovation: Asian companies customize Fineract for scalable, cost-effective solutions, integrating with mobile apps and DPI like India’s UPI, competing with proprietary systems.

Non-Profit Impact: IFTAS and the Mifos Initiative ensure accessibility for underserved communities, with Asian volunteers driving open-source contributions via GitHub.

Regional Fit: Fineract’s modular design supports Asia’s mobile-first, price-sensitive markets, addressing the needs of 2 billion unbanked.

Call to Action: Engage with Fineract’s community to develop, deploy, or support open-source fintech for Asia’s digital future.
