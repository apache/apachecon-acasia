Apache Cloudberry, a massively parallel processing (MPP) database based on Greenplum, entered the Apache Incubator with the vision of bringing analytical power to the open-source community. As one of the initiators and ongoing contributors to the project, I’ve had the opportunity to closely experience every stage of the incubation journey — from drafting the proposal and forming the PPMC to announcing and marketing promotion, to cleaning up the source code, and building community momentum.

In this talk, I will share firsthand insights into what it takes to navigate the Apache Incubator process effectively. I’ll highlight the challenges we faced, how we built a diverse and active community, ensured compliance with Apache’s governance and IP guidelines, and balanced open-source development with commercial interests. This session aims to offer practical guidance for new and prospective incubator projects, mentors, and contributors interested in sustaining healthy open-source ecosystems under the Apache Way.
