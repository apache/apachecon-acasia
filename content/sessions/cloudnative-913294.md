Since version 1.0.0, Apache IoTDB has provided a unified system monitoring framework, allowing database developers to define system monitoring indicators such as counters and register them for unified management, and supporting the Prometheus + Grafana monitoring indicator visualization solution. After a year of practice, 4 visual monitoring panels and a lot of tuning experience based on system monitoring have been formed.
