The fusion of Quantum Computing and AI is set to shatter the limits of classical computation, unlocking an era of hyper-intelligence. With quantum-enhanced models capable of exponential learning, solving complex problems in seconds, and redefining decision-making, are we entering a phase where AI will operate beyond human comprehension?

This session explores the next frontier of AI, focusing on:

Quantum Machine Learning (QML): How AI leverages quantum mechanics for unprecedented problem-solving

Quantum Neural Networks: Can AI learn at an unimaginable scale?

Superposition & Parallelism: Will AI evolve beyond sequential reasoning into a multi-dimensional thought process?

Theoretical implications: Could Quantum AI be the foundation for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)?

As we push toward AI-powered discovery, post-human intelligence, and a potential knowledge singularity, this talk will challenge conventional AI paradigms and explore what happens when AI no longer thinks like usâ€”but far beyond us.
