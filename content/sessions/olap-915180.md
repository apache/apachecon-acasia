Apache Impala is a native query engine implemented in MPP architecture for open data and table formats.

In this session, we will share the updates in the Impala community during the past year, including the core features of the 4.5 release, e.g. MERGE, OPTIMIZE statement support and Puffin file reading for Apache Iceberg tables, explicit language support for query and session management, and numerous performance improvements across a broad domain.

Updates on some on-going projects will also be shared, e.g. Calcite Planner, Intermediate Results Caching, Catalog scalability improvement, etc.

Finally, we'll explore Impala's roadmap, including the upcoming 5.0 release.
