In the era of AI application explosion, API traffic is surging, yet challenges like cost control, security compliance, and multi-model management persist. Apache APISIX, the world’s most active open-source API gateway, will officially launch its AI Gateway capability in 2025, offering a one-stop solution for developers and enterprises.

Why Choose APISIX AI Gateway?

Unified AI Service Management: Seamlessly proxy requests to mainstream LLMs like OpenAI, Deepseek, and QWen, avoid vendor lock-in, and optimize costs/performance through dynamic traffic orchestration.

Security & Compliance: Built-in AI protection plugins (e.g., ai-prompt-guard to filter malicious inputs, ai-rate-limiting for token-based throttling) ensure data privacy and compliance.

Developer-First Experience: Hot-reloading plugins, multi-language support (Java/Python/Go), and native integration with microservices and Kubernetes ecosystems.

Whether you’re a developer or an enterprise, APISIX AI Gateway accelerates AI adoption to unleash innovation potential.
