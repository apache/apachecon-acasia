As data pipelines grow more complex, traditional "push-and-forget" ETL approaches no longer enough. The data world is evolving—and it's taking a page from modern software engineering. Say hello to Branching and Tagging—concepts that have transformed code management and are now revolutionizing how we work with data.

In this session, we'll explore how Apache Hive, powered by Apache Iceberg, introduces these game-changing features into the data space. You'll learn how to streamline your workflows, manage data versions with ease, and build cleaner, more efficient pipelines.

We'll also dive into what's next for Apache Hive—giving you a front-row seat to the future of ETL. Whether you're a data engineer, architect, or simply passionate about data, this is your chance to stay ahead of the curve and level up your data operations.
