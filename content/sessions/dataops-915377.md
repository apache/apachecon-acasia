In this session, we will explore Apache SeaTunnel, a high-performance distributed data integration platform designed for seamless synchronization of massive datasets across heterogeneous sources. Attendees will gain insights into SeaTunnel’s core architecture, including its modular plugin system, unified abstractions leveraging Spark and Flink, and its evolution from V1 to V2 with enhanced scalability and engine-agnostic design. We will delve into advanced features such as dynamic sharding strategies, data sampling techniques, and optimized handling of string-based partitioning for efficient data distribution.

The session will also showcase a practical integration case with Cloudberry, demonstrating how SeaTunnel’s JDBC-based connector simplifies bidirectional data workflows while highlighting performance considerations. Finally, we’ll discuss future optimizations, including plans to leverage Cloudberry’s parallel processing via the gpfdist protocol for large-scale data migration. This talk is ideal for data engineers and architects seeking to streamline data integration workflows, break down silos, and harness the full potential of modern data ecosystems.
