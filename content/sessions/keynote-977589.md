With the surging global market demand for intelligent and digital products, for open-source, Infra, and numerous application developers, the phase of asking "Why" regarding overseas expansion has passed. Instead, they are now more focused on specific methodologies centered around "How".
This panel has invited practical experts with rich experience in overseas expansion of AI applications, founders of chuhaiqu.club, and community leader who has been in charge of the open source and developer ecosystems of multiple products. They will conduct an in-depth analysis of diversified growth paths in overseas markets, with a focus on effective customer acquisition methods, including: how to leverage influencer marketing to drive local community influence, accurately reach target users through social media and stimulate communication momentum, and how the product-led growth (PLG) model can reduce customer acquisition costs and improve conversion efficiency.Attention will also be paid to the opportunities for overseas expansion of open-source projects – expanding global influence through community strength and building collaborative ecosystems to facilitate user growth. 
Additionally, the empowerment of new technologies such as generative AI on growth strategies will be discussed. Through diverse perspectives, this panel aims to provide actionable overseas growth ideas for enterprises, developers, and entrepreneurs, helping them achieve commercial breakthroughs.

随着全球市场对智能化、数字化产品需求的激增，出海对于开源、Infra 和众多应用开发者而言，已经走过问“Why”的阶段，更关注围绕“How”展开的具体的方法论。本次 Panel 我们邀请到了有着丰富 AI 应用出海经验的实战专家、出海去孵化器的创始人和曾负责过多个产品开源与开发者生态的社区领袖，为大家深入解析海外市场的多元化增长路径，重点探讨实效获客手段，包括：如何借助红人营销撬动本地圈层影响力，通过社交媒体精准触达目标用户并激发传播势能，以产品为核心的 PLG 模式如何降低获客成本、提升转化效率。同时关注开源项目的出海机遇 —— 依托社区力量扩大全球影响力，构建协作生态助力用户增长。​
此外，还将探讨生成式 AI 等新技术对增长策略的赋能。通过多元视角，为企业、开发者、创业者提供可落地的出海增长思路，助力实现商业突破。
