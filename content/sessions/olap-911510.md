title: "Accelerating Spark jobs with Apache Gluten at ByteDance Scale"
date: ""
track: "olap"
presenters: "Weiting Chen"
stype: "Chinese Session"

During this talk, we will present how ByteDance leverages the native engine, which is based on the open-source Gluten framework and in-house native acceleration engine Bolt, to drive significant cost saving in Spark use cases. Apache Gluten is pivotal, acting as middleware to seamlessly integrate native backends and enhance Spark performance. We will also cover the best practices for rolling it out in EB-scale data warehouses in the production environment and the optimizations on performance & compatibility, along with our future roadmaps.
