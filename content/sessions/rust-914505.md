title: "AIScript - how to write an interpreter language in Rust"
date: ""
track: "rust"
presenters: "Shuang Zhu"
stype: "English Session"

I'll share my journey building AIScript, a new interpreter language specifically designed for AI application development.
This talk will dive deep into language implementation techniques using Rust, covering:

1. Language Implementation Architecture
- Building a robust lexer with comprehensive error reporting
- Implementing a recursive descent parser
- Creating an efficient bytecode compiler and virtual machine
- Designing a module system that supports both native and script modules

2. Novel Language Features
- AI-native primitives: Built-in support for prompts, agents (inspired by OpenAI Swarm), and AI function
- Unique error handling syntax inspired by Rust/Zig/Golang
- Builtin data validation similar to Python's Pydantic
- Encapsulates Rust's best practice of web development (axum, sqlx, etc) into the language syntax

3. Real-world Challenges
- Garbage collector using gc-arena
- Performance optimizations in the VM
- Type checking and validation implementation
