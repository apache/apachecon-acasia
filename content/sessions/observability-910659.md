In this sharing session, I will focus on BanyanDB's innovative hot-warm-cold architecture, a design that marks a significant leap forward in modern system observability. We will analyze why tiered architecture is the optimal choice for managing massive metrics, traces, and logging data, and how BanyanDB ingeniously puts this concept into practice while balancing excellent performance, cost-effectiveness, and data storage efficiency.

This presentation will reveal the core advantages of BanyanDB's architecture: it not only provides instant insights and accelerates decision-making processes but also significantly reduces operational costs while ensuring data storage scalability. These features collectively establish BanyanDB's foundational position in the field of efficient observability.
