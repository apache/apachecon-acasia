In this talk, I'll focus on BanyanDB's innovative hot-warm-cold architecture, a design that marks a major leap forward in the field of modern system observability. We will explain why a tiered architecture is the right choice for managing massive amounts of metrics, tracking, and logging data, and how BanyanDB skillfully puts this concept into practice while balancing superior performance, cost-effectiveness, and data storage efficiency.

This session will reveal the core benefits of the BanyanDB architecture: it not only provides instant insights to accelerate decision-making, but also significantly reduces operational costs while ensuring scalability of data storage. Together, these attributes make BanyanDB a cornerstone in the field of efficient observability.
