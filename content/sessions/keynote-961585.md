This is my seventh year at The Apache Software Foundation. Starting as a contributor, I earned my first commit bit while working on the Apache Flink project. The more I contribute to ASF projects, the more credits I earn in their community.

Now I'm a board member of the ASF and an active incubator mentor who has mentored more than seven podling projects. Welcome to join this session to learn how I grow in the broader ASF community, and what I'm looking for on collborators in the ASF for the following years.
