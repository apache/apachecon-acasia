Apache TinkerPop offers a robust framework for graph computing, essential for managing complex data interactions. 
In the realm of API discovery, traditional methods (e.g. vector database) often struggle with the precision and scale required 
for precise and real-time interactions. Precise and efficient data aggregation is crucial for delivering accurate and timely responses in API discovery. NuGraph, eBay's proprietary graph database solution, utilizes Apache TinkerPop to efficiently manage intricate data structures. On top of it, a novel approach was built with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform aggregation queries.
By integrating NuGraph, we aim to enhance the query resolution process, significantly improving interactions through faster 
and more precise API discovery.
