In this session, I will explore how to seamlessly integrate large language models (LLMs), graph databases, and spreadsheets using Apache Hop.

Designed with beginners in mind—especially those who currently create or update their data manually—I will cover the essentials of building automated workflows that drastically reduce repetitive tasks.

You will learn best practices for designing data pipelines, leveraging key plugins, and streamlining complex data flows, all centered on Apache Hop’s next-generation capabilities.

Discover how this flexible integration approach can open new doors for both machine learning initiatives and data management, surpassing the limitations of traditional ETL tools. 

Join us to unlock greater efficiency and innovation in your data workflows.
