Enterprises today struggle to harness AI’s full potential due to fragmented data systems, inefficient pipelines, and silos between analytics and machine learning. Apache Cloudberry, an open-source MPP data warehouse, redefines this paradigm by deeply integrating data processing with AI - eliminating barriers and accelerating innovation.
In this session, we’ll demonstrate how Cloudberry enables:
- Unified Execution – Run native AI/ML models (e.g., PyTorch, Scikit-learn) directly on warehouse data.
- Multi-Modal Analytics – Process structured and unstructured data (PDFs, images, and other documents) in a unified framework.
- Smart Data Applications – Build RAG-enhanced QA, ChatBI, and multimodal search.
You can learn how to converge data and intelligence into one platform, reducing complexity while scaling AI workloads in this session.
