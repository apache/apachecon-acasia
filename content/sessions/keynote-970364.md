In an era where software is eating the world, code serves as the cornerstone, laying the foundation for the prosperity of the internet age. Today, driven by AI, it is ushering in the next leap forward. We can now interact with large models using natural language to generate executable code, leverage IDEs to automatically sense and complete code logic, and employ intelligent agents to debug complex applications. AI is transforming programming from a skill reserved for the few into a tool for many to bring their ideas to life. This is not just a surge in productivity—it’s a redefinition of the boundaries of development. TRAE, The Real AI Engineer, aims to empower developers worldwide to enhance their R&D efficiency and accelerate software innovation.
