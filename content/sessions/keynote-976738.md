AI is reshaping software development at an unprecedented pace. As AI becomes developers' "super collaborator," does the leap in development efficiency come with a restructuring of capability requirements? How will the intelligentization of toolchains break down technical barriers and spawn new career tracks? Facing the new balance of human-machine collaboration, how should developers break through and evolve?

This panel brings together tech experts from AutoCoder, Linkerbot，SiliconFlow, and ByteDance. With deep expertise in AI-assisted development tools, intelligent programming frameworks, and engineering practices, they will multi-dimensionally analyze how AI is reconstructing the entire process from code generation and debugging optimization to system architecture, while exploring the opportunities and challenges for developers behind this transformation. Tang Xiaoyin, Executive Editor-in-Chief of CSDN & *New Programmer*, will host this panel, connecting insights with her seasoned industry perspective and guiding guests to focus on core issues.

This panel goes beyond technical discussions—it concerns the future positioning of every developer. Here, cutting-edge practices collide with in-depth reflections, potentially outlining a clear blueprint for the development in the AI era.

AI 正在以前所未有的速度重塑软件开发，当 AI 成为开发者的“超级协作者”，开发效率的跃升是否伴随能力要求的重构？工具链的智能化如何打破技术壁垒，又将催生哪些新的职业赛道？面对人机协作的新平衡，开发者该如何突围与进化？

本次圆桌我们邀请到了来自 AutoCoder 的祝威廉、灵心巧手的苏洋、硅基流动的杨攀与字节跳动的王涛，他们深耕 AI 辅助开发工具、智能编程框架及工程实践，将从技术落地、场景革新到生态构建，多维剖析 AI 如何重构代码生成、调试优化乃至系统架构的全流程，并探讨这背后为开发者带来的机遇和挑战。CSDN & 《新程序员》执行总编唐小引将担任这一 Panel 的主持人，以资深行业视角串联思辨，引导嘉宾聚焦核心命题。

这场对话不止于技术探讨，更关乎每一位开发者的未来坐标。在这里，前沿实践与深度思考碰撞，或将为你勾勒出 AI 时代开发领域的清晰蓝图。
