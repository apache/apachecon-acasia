After joining OceanBase Cloud Native SIG, I wrote the command line management tool for OceanBase in k8s, called okctl, which can support the management of resources such as clusters, tenants, and backup strategies. At the same time, it also provides component installation and updates, simple cluster construction, and cluster connection functions.  We later combined the MCP protocol and used okctl as the backend to build the MCP server, which provides the integrated function of cluster interaction, management, and inspection using natural language.
