date: ""
track: "ai"

stype: "Chinese Session"

In this session, we’ll explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be systematically integrated into GitHub Actions to enhance code quality and security in Apache projects, story behind the real-world example of apache/brpc#2911. Is ideal for developers and maintainers seeking actionable, low-overhead strategies to design, implements and deploy AI agent for code quality assurance. 
We'll incentivize audience thinking on:
Human-AI Collaboration: Contrast the traditional "copilot" model (human-driven, synchronous) with asynchronous AI agent workflows in pipelines, highlighting efficiency gains and trade-offs. 
We’ll bridge theory and practice, as
Practical LLM Integration: Learn how to leverage LLMs for targeted tasks like code robustness scanning and CVE detection — without relying on RAG, fine-tuning, or MCP —while working within resource constraints.
