The lakehouse architecture has emerged as a transformative trend in recent years. By leveraging Flink as a stream-batch unified processing engine and Paimon as a stream-batch unified lake format, the Streaming Lakehouse architecture has enabled real-time data freshness for the lakehouse. While structured data remains widely used in Paimon, semi-structured and unstructured data are becoming increasingly critical in artificial intelligence applications. The Flink and Paimon communities have collaborated closely, combining their strengths and integrating cutting-edge features to deliver significant enhancements and optimizations for users. 
In this talk, we will introduce some of the important work, including:
* How Flink and Paimon utilize the Variant data type and variant shredding to enhance performance when handling semi-structured data
* How Flink leverages Paimonâ€™s bucket mechanism to accelerate joins with Paimon dimension tables
* Enhancements to simplify and improve the user experience in managing a data lakehouse
