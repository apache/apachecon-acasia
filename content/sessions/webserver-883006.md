Performance bottlenecks can make or break your app, but load testing often gets pushed aside during development. In the open-source world, why aren't we treating performance testing as a shared responsibility? This talk shows how developers, testers, and infrastructure engineers can collaborate to build scalable Python applications.

We'll use a Django case study and Apache JMeter to demonstrate effective stress-testing techniques and common pitfalls to avoid. We'll also explore open-source tools like Locust and k6, and discuss how the community can contribute by sharing test plans, scripts, and best practices. Think of it as open-sourcing your load testing strategy.

Beyond the technical aspects, this session emphasizes collective knowledge. Imagine a world where shared test suites and benchmarking efforts become the normâ€”where Python apps benefit from community-driven testing.
