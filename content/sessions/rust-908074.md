Foyer is a hybrid in-memory and disk cache library in Rust. For systems utilizing Apache OpenDAL to access object stores, integrating Foyer can significantly enhance access performance and reduce costs. In this session, we will delve into the Foyer system and its integration with Apache OpenDAL. Additionally, we will present real-world case studies, such as RisingWave, to illustrate the benefits that Foyer and Apache OpenDAL bring to object store-based storage systems.
