AI applications and data science workflows increasingly rely on unstructured data. Apache Cloudberry introduces Directory Table, a new table type designed to manage unstructured data natively within the database. It supports unified metadata management, integration with in-database analytics, and advanced data science workflows. 
This talk will walk through the design philosophy, implementation details, and usage examples of the Directory Table, illustrating how it bridges structured and unstructured data in a unified platform.
