We are standing at the forefront of a paradigm shift in human-computer interaction. Large language models are breaking boundaries every day, yet a key challenge remains: how can we enable AI to interact with applications across diverse platforms in a unified and secure way? AgentKit is a bold response to this challenge — a cross-platform AI automation framework envisioned on the foundation of Rust’s safety and the open-source ecosystem.

This talk will take you on a journey beginning with our experimental results on the Android platform via Droidrun.ai, leading into the full blueprint of AgentKit. We’ll explore how key projects in the Apache ecosystem can accelerate its development. You’ll see why Rust is the ideal language for building this system, how AccessKit provides critical cross-platform bridging capabilities, and how AgentKit can collaborate with emerging AI protocols such as Claude MCP and Google A2A.

I will demonstrate how AgentKit’s flexible architecture supports a range of deployment models — from purely client-side to hybrid cloud — while maintaining strong security boundaries. This is not just a vision-sharing session, but an open invitation to the community: to join us in transforming AgentKit from concept to reality, integrating the maturity of the Apache ecosystem with cutting-edge AI capabilities to build a truly borderless future of intelligent automation.
